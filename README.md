# data-app

This project is a mandatory assignment for the Computer Science Programme @ KEA.

This project is a web application that displays information about characters from the TV show South Park. It allows you to view the characters in either a grid or table format, and clicking on a character's image or name will open a dialog with more detailed information about that character.

## Preview
See a live demonstration [here](https://osman-butt.github.io/data-app/)

## Data
The character data used in this project was sourced from https://cederdorff.github.io/dat-js/05-data/southpark.json.
